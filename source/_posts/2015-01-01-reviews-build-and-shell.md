* Level Ent. 

This is a tiny book for Git. It is good because it is short and simple. It covers basic usage of Git and a little about GitHub. It is particular good for people who want to learn Git from Zero. The is another link about GitHub call [GotGitHub](http://www.worldhello.net/gotgithub/), which is also recommended reading after this. The only pity is that it does not cover any advanced topics. Here is my [my book note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/sh/f2cf70fa-6f1c-483b-9eab-23e52462f09e/4a50f05a3852edeb5a5fca7d03ed8d87)

This is a complete beginner's workflow for version control of common documents and content. It has examples used are from non-techie, day to day computing activities for Git enter and middle level. It covers basic usage of Git and a little about Bitbucket in chapter 4. This book has very dtail of git command in terms of command output and how to run it in both git GUI and CLI.

This is a few books having details about Maven 3, which is am excellent Java project management tools. This book not only cover the basic knowledge of maven, but also introduce related tools, like Hudson. In addition, there are more good maven readings such as, [Maven Complete Reference](http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/index.html), and [Maven Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/)

This is a good begining guide for fresh people in linux programming. It is also a good quick review book. I never learn linux form books but from using experence and system manuals. This is a a free book which is recommanded to read to learn Linux in systematic way.
