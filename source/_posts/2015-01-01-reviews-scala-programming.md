This book has very quick style of explaining scala with many detail examples. Even some examples has code defect and typo, it is easy to find out. The last part about scala best practice is really a valueable chapter. The other part is ok and cover everthing well enough but not deep enough.

The book is my 1st book read about scala. It introduces the basic concet of scala as well as advanced topics. The last few chapters are little hard to read, but overall it is a great scala book having latest of scala features covered.
